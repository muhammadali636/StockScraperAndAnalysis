This project is a Python-based tool designed to fetch and analyze Reddit posts related to specific stock symbols or keywords. It uses machine learning and NLP techniques to filter, analyze, and display posts relevant to stock analysis. The final output includes a summary of stock-related posts with their sentiment scores.

Next steps: Build a Flask web app with user login, connect a database, and develop a React frontend. A lot to come!
